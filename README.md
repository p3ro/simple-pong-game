This is a pong game created only with HTML and Javascript as a small fun project. 
It took about 5 hours to complete with sound effects (the applause and launch sound effects are from https://pixabay.com/ and the rest are made by me)
and some very simple animations.

The left paddle is controled with 'w' and 's' and the right paddle is controled with the 'Up' and 'Down" arrows. The game starts as soon as the page loads. You can pause with 'Escape' or 'Backspace' and restart with 'r'
